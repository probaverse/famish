Description: The goal of famish is to refine a **fam**ily of distributions 
    to meet specific requirements, often derived from real data. This 
    includes parameter estimation methods like maximum likelihood, as well 
    as partial constraints such as mean matching. The name "famish" reflects 
    the process of narrowing down a broad family of distributions to those 
    that best fit your needs.
