Right now, famish is a quick-and-dirty package that simply bundles together my quick-and-dirty functions for fitting some distributions that can be found in the distionary package.

The goal of famish is to refines a **fam**ily of distributions to match real-world data or specific characteristics, such as a given mean or dataset. From parameter estimation to maximum likelihood, famish offers tools for selecting the best-fitting distribution for your needs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of famish from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("probaverse/famish")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(famish)
x <- stats::rnorm(30)
fit_dst_norm(x)
```
